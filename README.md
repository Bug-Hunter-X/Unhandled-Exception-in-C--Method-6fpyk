# Unhandled Exception in C# Method

This repository demonstrates a common error in C# programming: improper exception handling. The `ExampleClass` contains a method `MyMethod` that throws a generic `Exception` without providing specific information about the error. This makes debugging and error handling difficult.

The solution demonstrates how to improve exception handling by providing more details in custom exceptions, which improves the clarity of error messages and aids in debugging.
